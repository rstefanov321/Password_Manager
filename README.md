# Password_Manager
A password manager GUI that accepts website name, email address and password (can be automatically generated) and saves it into a text file. It also comes with data validation (empty fields, confirmation of saving the input data). 

Update from 11.01, new features added:
- Search function that goes through a JSON file and fetches the email and password details for a given website. 
- Error handling messages for missing JSON file or missing data in the existing JSON file.
